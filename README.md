## Accomplished tasks

Implemented reading logic for SVG elements in readSVG and method declarations in the respective classes
Declared virtual pure functions in SVGElements.hpp, corresponding to each transformation. And implemented them in each class for better parsing and application of transformations with a common logic for all elements
Reading logic for Element transformations is also on readSVG.cpp
Passing at Geometrical elements tests; All transformations and transform-origin transformations passing except of translate, because of the way translation tests have no commas separating each coordinate.
